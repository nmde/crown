## Development mode
First, `npm run test` must have been run at least once to make sure the data necessary for development mode is present in the database.
Then, start the server with `npm run backend`. This will compile and run the backend. This command must be re-run every time the backend code is modified to see the changes.
Finally, run `npm run storybook`. This will eventually automatically open a page in your browser where you can see the pages and components of the app. This page will automatically refresh every time the frontend code is changed.
